# Simple-Scala-Spark
Very basic boilerplate files for Apache Spark projects. Written in Scala.

I use Spark for big data projects, which could mean I'm streaming data, parsing CSVs, or simply batch processing huge amounts of data in any given format. However, I don't use it very frequently as it's currently not one the technologies my employer uses. So, I'm using this repo to save myself a few minutes of confusion every time I do begin a new project and realize that I have completely forgotten how to write code since my last project. Spark is an excellent tool, but can be somewhat overwhelming for beginners and those who are out of practice alike, so hopefully this repo helps.
